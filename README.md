  Hey again ! Another project that had just been made and now it was made by my own without the use of a tutorial. In that project I focused in create a system of login with users and hash passwords, something that I didnt had any idea of what was about. To achieve it, it was used the combo of flask-login with werkzug, to manipulate the users and it's functions(active or not for example) and to generate and check the password hashed.
  
  To check the project all you have to do is install the packages of pipfile, what is similar to a requirements.txt, and run flask in cmd. I also installed and used the package python-dotenv to make it easier for development with flask, but it's totally optional.
  
  As always, fell free to comment, send e-mail, use it or whatever with it. I hope it help you as helped me to achieve your goals!
